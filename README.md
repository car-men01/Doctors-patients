# Doctors-patients
This C++ application opens a new window for each doctor and lists its patients. Each patient is allocated to a doctor according to the doctor's name and specialization, or if a patient is undiagnosed it will be listed in every doctor's window. The application allows the user to: filter diagnosed patients, add patients and update patients.

## GUI
The GUI is made using the QT library in QT designer. On startup, the application will open a new window for every doctor.\

## Observer design pattern
The Observer design pattern in this application ensures that whenever a patient is updated, all relevant doctor windows are notified of the change. This is how it works:
- Repository as a Subject: Repository inherits from Subject, which maintains a list of Observer* (doctor windows). The repository stores patients and doctors and can modify them.
- Observers (Doctor Windows): Each doctor's window registers itself as an Observer to the Repository using addObserver(). These windows implement the update() method to refresh their patient lists when notified.
- Automatic Updates via notify(): When a patient is added or updated (addPatient(), updatePatient()), notify() is called, which loops through all observers and calls their update() method. This ensures that when a patientâ€™s doctor or specialization changes, all doctor windows automatically reflect the updated distribution.
<\br>This setup keeps the UI in sync with the repository, ensuring real-time updates across multiple windows.
